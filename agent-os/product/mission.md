## The Problem

### Signal in the Noise

Developers and tech enthusiasts are drowning in content but starving for genuine insight. Most technical blogs are either too shallow, too promotional, or lack the personal perspective that makes content truly valuable.

**Our Solution:** A personal blog that prioritizes quality over quantity, sharing real experiences and perspectives from an active practitioner. Content focuses on what actually works, presented with a clean, distraction-free reading experience.

## Differentiators

### Authentic Practitioner Perspective

Unlike aggregated content sites or corporate blogs, pietersz.me offers first-hand experiences and honest assessments from someone actively working in AI development workflows. This results in actionable insights readers can immediately apply.

### Thoughtful Reading Experience

Unlike cluttered blog platforms, pietersz.me provides a minimalist, retro-inspired design with features like sidenotes, excellent typography, and dark/light modes. This results in a reading experience that respects the reader's attention.

### Focused Content Pillars

Unlike general tech blogs covering everything, pietersz.me maintains focus on four interconnected areas: AI Development Workflow, Productivity, Homelab, and Developer Experiments. This results in coherent, deep content rather than shallow breadth.
