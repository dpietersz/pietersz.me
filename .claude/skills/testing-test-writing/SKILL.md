name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write minimal, strategic tests focused on core user flows and critical paths with clear test names, mocked dependencies, and fast execution. Use this skill when creating or editing test files, writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. When testing critical user workflows, core business logic, or primary application features. When working with test files (e.g., `*.test.js`, `*.spec.ts`, `*_test.py`, `*_spec.rb`), test frameworks (Jest, RSpec, pytest, JUnit), or testing utilities. When mocking external dependencies, databases, or APIs in tests.

# Testing Test Writing

## When to use this skill

- When creating or editing test files (`.test.js`, `.spec.ts`, `_test.py`, `_spec.rb`)
- When writing unit tests for core business logic
- When testing critical user workflows and primary features
- When implementing integration tests for key system interactions
- When writing end-to-end tests for main user journeys
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- When creating clear, descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- When ensuring tests execute quickly (milliseconds for unit tests)
- When testing behavior rather than implementation details
- When completing feature implementation and adding strategic tests at logical points
- When working with test frameworks (Jest, RSpec, pytest, JUnit, Mocha, etc.)

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.
