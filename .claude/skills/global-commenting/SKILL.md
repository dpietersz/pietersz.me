name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with minimal, helpful comments that explain complex logic without documenting temporary changes or fixes. Use this skill when adding comments to code, documenting functions or classes, or explaining complex algorithms. When writing or editing any code file that may benefit from explanatory comments. When reviewing existing comments to ensure they remain evergreen and relevant. When deciding whether code needs comments or if better naming and structure would be clearer. This skill applies to all code files in any programming language including `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.rb`, `.java`, `.go`, `.php`, and others.
