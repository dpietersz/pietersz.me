name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, specific exception types, centralized error handling, graceful degradation, and proper resource cleanup. Use this skill when implementing try-catch blocks, error boundaries, exception handling, or error recovery logic. When working with API error responses, validation errors, or external service failures. When adding error logging, retry strategies, or fallback mechanisms. This skill applies to all code files that handle errors, exceptions, or failure scenarios in any programming language including `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.rb`, `.java`, `.go`, `.php`, and others.

# Global Error Handling

## When to use this skill

- When implementing try-catch blocks or exception handling in any code file
- When creating error messages for users or API responses
- When validating input and handling validation failures
- When implementing centralized error handling (error boundaries, middleware, global handlers)
- When working with external API calls or service integrations
- When implementing retry strategies or exponential backoff
- When ensuring graceful degradation when services fail
- When cleaning up resources (file handles, database connections, network sockets)
- When choosing specific exception types over generic errors
- When implementing error logging or monitoring
- When handling transient failures or network errors

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global error handling.
