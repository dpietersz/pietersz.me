Welcome to pietersz.me.

This is the first post on my personal blog, and I wanted to start by explaining what this space is about and why I built it.

## Who Am I?

I'm Dimitri Pietersz, a Data Engineer based in the Netherlands. I spend my days building data pipelines, solving engineering challenges, and exploring the intersection of AI and productivity. I'm currently working on [Surpassion](https://surpassion.nl) - my first SaaS product, and this blog is part of that journey.

The name "Surpassion" comes from two words: "surpassing yourself with passion." It represents my approach to work and life: continuous improvement driven by genuine enthusiasm.

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be writing about:

- **AI Development Workflows** - How I'm leveraging AI tools to enhance productivity and build better software
- **Data Engineering** - Patterns, tools, and lessons learned from building data systems
- **Productivity** - Systems and approaches that actually work in the real world
- **Homelab Experiments** - Infrastructure, self-hosting, and technical tinkering
- **Building in Public** - The journey of creating Surpassion from scratch

Occasionally, I'll also share insights from my day job working with Databricks, Azure Data Factory, and Power BI - though those posts will be less frequent.

{{< sidenote >}}This blog itself is an experiment in minimal, retro-styled web design. Built with Hugo and the Gruvbox theme, it's designed to be fast, readable, and distraction-free.{{< /sidenote >}}

## Why Blog?

Honestly, I've started blogs before and abandoned them. This time feels different because I'm not trying to be a "content creator" or build an audience. I'm writing to:

1. **Document what I'm learning** - Writing forces clarity of thought
2. **Share useful patterns** - If something helped me, it might help others
3. **Think out loud** - Some problems become clearer when you explain them

This blog is as much for future-me as it is for anyone else reading.

## What's Next?

I have several posts brewing about:
- My current AI workflow setup with Claude and custom tools
- Building reliable data pipelines with Python and dbt
- Setting up a homelab for development and experimentation

Stay tuned. Or don't - there's no pressure here. I'll be writing either way.
